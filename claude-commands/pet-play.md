description: Play with your pet (ball, frisbee, puzzle, laser, rope, bubbles)

Play with the pet using:

!node $PET_PATH/bin/claude-code-tamagotchi.cjs play $ARGUMENTS

Then respond with something playful like: "Playtime was INTENSE! Your pet is now collapsed in a heap, tongue out, claiming they 'won' whatever game you just played. They definitely need a nap after that! 🎾😴"
